### Big data addresses distinct requirements

1. combine multiple unrealated datasets
    
2. process large amounts of unstructured data
    
3. Harvest hidden information in a time-sensitive manner
    

### Terminology

1. a dataset is a collection or group of related data
    
2. Data analysis is the process of examining data to find facts relationships, or trends...
    
3. data analytics: the complete data lifecycle, which encompasses collecting, cleansing, organizing...
    
4. descriptive analytics:
    
    answer questions about events that have already occurrd.
    
5. Diagnostic analytics: determine the cause of a phenomenon that occurred in the apst
    
6. Predictive analytics: aim to determine the outcome of an event that might occur in the future
    
7. Prescriptive analytics build upon the results of predictive analytics by prescribing actions that should be taken
    

### Big data characteristics

1. volume
    
2. velocity
    
3. vriety
    
4. Veracity: quality of data
    

- signal is data that has value and leads to meaningful information

- noise is data taht can't be converted in to information

- registeration: high signal to noise ratio

- blog posting usually have low signal to noise ratio

5. Value: usefulnesss of data for an enterprise
    

value is also impacted by data lifecycle related concerns like how well has the data been stored?

### Different types of data

source: machine/human

format:

1. structured data: conforms to a data model or schema, more often stored in a relational database
    
2. unstructured data:
    
    - textual or binary, like video, image files, audio
        
3. Semi-structured data:
    
    - a defined level of structure and consistency, but is not relational in nature. It is hierarchical or graph-based
        
        - like xml, json, sensor...
            
4. Metadata
    
    - provides information about a dataset's characteristics and structure. it is mostly machine-generated and can be appended to data
        
        - XML tags
            
        - Attributes
